Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck
-----------------------

  This dice gambling game challenges its players to collect
as many worm tiles from the grill as they can!

  The grill is the centerpiece of the board and will
highlight which tiles you are able to purchase on your turn.
Each tile shows how many points you need to have rolled to
take it and how many victory points
its worth, denoted by 'Worm(s)'.

Rolling phase:
  The current player rolls eight dice then selects all dice
of a number/symbol that they have not collected yet. They
may continue rolling until there are no dice left, or they
bust.
  A bust occurs when the player cannot choose any dice
from the rolled pool OR they have not collected a worm symbol
once they finish the rolling phase OR they do not have enough
points to participate in the buying phase.
  - Upon a bust, the player must return their top most worm
    tile to the grill and remove the highest value tile on the
    grill from the game.

Buying phase:
  The player may buy any worm tile from the grill that is less
than or equal to the points they acquired in the rolling phase
OR if their points are equal to the topmost tile of another
player, they may steal it instead. The player stacks their new
worm tile on top of previously acquired tiles.
  - Players must have at least one worm symbol (W) in order
    to purchase a tile.

Ending:
  The game ends once there are no more worms on the grill OR
a player collects a total of 7 or more victory points.
